Fay Folk are small fay creatures from the Dreamwild who occasionally appear on the fringes of civilized lands. Few Fay Folk look alike, and many have animal features. Most fay use glamour to hide their true appearance, but this particular one seems to prefer not to. He claims to be an emperor, albeit small. He proudly wears invisible clothes befitting his status.
