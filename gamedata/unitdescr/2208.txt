In the God Forest, monstrous spiders large enough to catch elephants live. Since the unsealing of the God Mountain Machakan sorcerers have caught and trained the monstrous spiders as sacred mounts for the Black Hunters, but sometimes sorcery is used to summon and command entire groups of Hunter Spiders. Spiders bound with magic must be commanded by mages at all times, but they do not act erratically as the mounts of the Black Hunters might do if left without rider.
