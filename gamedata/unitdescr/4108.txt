At the dawn of time, monsters and giants roamed the world. Among the beasts was a Great Moose that emerged from the primal forests of the nascent world. As a creature of the wild it was worshiped by the first of men as a god of the forest and crowned king of all that lived in the woods. When the previous Pantokrator rose to power he hunted the Moose slayed it and imprisoned its spirit in the forest from which it came. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the shackles are weakening and the spirit of the Great Moose can manifest itself and bring good will to its worshippers.
