Vanarus is ruled by Vanir, but humans compose most of the population and are frequently used in warfare. The Rusian warriors of old fought with a fury reputedly granted them by their Bear God. Now the rage has faded and only the Chudes and a few human warriors still fight with unquenchable fury. The Vanarusian Berserkers are not as strong or skilled as the Einheres of Vanheim, but they are still among the most feared units at Vanarus disposal.
