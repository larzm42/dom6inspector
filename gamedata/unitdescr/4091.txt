When the Chudes were accepted into the Black Order it soon became evident that they needed stronger mounts. With the aid of the Antlered Veduns moose were caught, trained and imbued with magic. These sacred moose are stronger and smarter than wild moose, but they are strong willed and difficult to ride, even for an experienced horseman. The sacred moose are equipped with plate bardings of Ulmish design crafted by the Vedun Mage Smiths.
