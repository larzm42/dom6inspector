Pyrène is a feudal kingdom reminiscent of Marignon, but with an unusual legacy. The inhabitants of the mountain kingdom are descendants of the Bekrydes, cave-dwelling humans of the caverns below the Pyrènian mountains. The armies of the kingdom are similar to those of other feudal lands, with footmen, knights and men at arms. Their crossbowmen, however, are inferior as their Bekryde ancestry limits their eyesight.
