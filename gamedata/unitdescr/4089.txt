When the Black Knights finally surrendered and swore allegiance to the Chudes there were not many of them left. The Chudes were impressed by the strength of the knights and a few of them approached the last human Hochmeister with a petition. If allowed to be ordained as knights they would swear allegiance to the Hochmeister and replenish the ranks of the order. The Hochmeister complied and Chud warriors were accepted into the order. With time the Chud knights became more numerous and influential, and when the last human Hochmeister died he was replaced by a Chude. But something had happened when the magic of Fort Vedun was awakened. The strange magic of the Dreamwild started to permeate the citadel and ever more Chudes were born with antlers, superior strength and sometimes even magic abilities. With time these antlered Chudes replaced the ungifted Chud knights and now all Hochmeisters of the Sylvan Order are chosen from antlered Chudes gifted with magic powers.
