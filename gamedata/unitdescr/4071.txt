Most Zemaitians live in small settlements in the wild forests of Zemaitia. For centuries they have avoided contact with other cultures and are adept at moving unseen through their lands. In warfare these rural Zemaitians rely on stealth and traditional weapons rather than the technology of the Ulmish conquerors. Some chieftains can afford to equip their soldiers with armaments of higher quality and organize them into disciplined units. The Zemaitians have lived in forests steeped in magic for centuries and have developed some resistance to magical influences.
