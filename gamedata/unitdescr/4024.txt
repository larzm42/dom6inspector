The Mother Mandragora was once a giant of divine heritage born in primordial times. She was given powers over all things growing by a previous Pantokrator. Her blessings and gifts to mankind were numerous and she brought fertility and life to the world. With time the half-men of the wild forests as well as mankind sought comfort in her divine embrace. Jealous of all that would contest his omnipotence, the Pantokrator slew his servant and trapped her soul in her mortal remains, overgrown by vines and roots. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the old decrees are weakening and the vengeful soul of the dead Titan is slowly awakening, reanimating her carcass prison and causing the wild woods to dream the Dark Dream of Vengeance.
