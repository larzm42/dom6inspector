The Castellan is the commander and governor of a castle. They sometimes lead their soldiers in military campaigns, but for the most part the Pyrènian armies are led by Marquess knight commanders or Cambion Counts. The castellan is skilled in organizing castle defenses. Like other Pyrènians they are of Bekryde descent and resistant to the elements.
