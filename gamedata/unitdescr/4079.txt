In the Moonwood, where the dweomer of the Dreamwild was awakened in order to defeat the Ulmish invaders, Chud and human warriors don the furs of wild beasts and abandon culture. The awakened magic of the Dreamwild permeates their very bodies, endowing them with strange powers. When wounded their animal skins merge with their bodies, transforming them into savage beasts. Chud Skinshifters take the shape of the bear, an animal that has been revered by the Chudes since time immemorial. Chud Skinshifters fight with great axes until their spilled blood transforms them into beastly bears. The enchanted furs and transformative abilities of the Skinshifters allow them to heal even the most grievous wounds.
