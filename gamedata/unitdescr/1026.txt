The Carrion Dragon is the living carcass of an ancient Dragon of tremendous physical and magical power. Born before the history of time, the dragons were perceived as threats to the world and imprisoned by the previous Pantokrator millennia ago. The Carrion Dragon was slain by one of the Pantokrator's Generals in a deep and wild forest and its soul was trapped in its moss-covered corpse. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the old decrees are weakening and the vengeful soul of the dead Dragon is slowly awakening, reanimating its carcass prison and causing the wild woods to dream the Dark Dream of Vengeance.
The Carrion Dragon is able to adopt the shape of a dead Pan. The body of the Carrion Dragon is less suited for spell casting than the shape of the Pan. In dragon shape most of its magic skills are reduced. The paths of Death and Nature are innate to the Carrion Dragon and his skills in those paths are less reduced.
