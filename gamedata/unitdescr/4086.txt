The Chud Vedun is a sorcerer of the wild woods of Zemaitia. They have served the Seniunas as advisors and keepers of the old ways. They often share religious duties with the Seniunas and some Chud settlements have several mage-priests working in collaboration. Many Veduns resent the new ways and will outright obstruct attempts by progressive Seniunas to adopt human ways.
