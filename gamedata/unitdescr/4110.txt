Visvaldas was one of the first Chudes ordained as a knight and to receive a moose mount. He was strong and devoted to prove the worth of the Chudes to the human Hochmeister. However, soon after being ordained his dreams became troubled and dark. He sought advice among the knights as well as the Antlered Veduns, but they could not give him solace. One evening, when the moon rose above the Moonwood, he entered the forest astride his moose, never to be seen again.This was before the dreamwild transformation, when the Chudes were merely strong warriors without any faywrought gifts.

One morning, half an age later when the pines of the Moonwood had withered and regrown three times over, a great antlered knight emerged from the Moonwood, dressed in the splendour of the Fay and riding a great moose wreathed in the glamour of the dreamwild. He claimed the name Visvaldas and displayed intimate knowledge of the order's regulations and customs. But he was obviously no longer what he had been and many a Vedun suspected that he was but a dream or memory that had escaped from the Dreamwild. With reluctance he was accepted as a Sylvan Knight and was given command over his peers. Time will tell if this was the right decision.
