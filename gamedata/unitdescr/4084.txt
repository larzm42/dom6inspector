Chudes are an exalted race of might and beauty far superior to ordinary men. They have lived in the Zemaitian woodlands since before the arrival of men, but for a long time they have lived side by side with humans. After the Black Knights had surrendered, some Zemaitians adopted the ways of the Ulmish conquerors, but the Chudes kept to the old ways. They live in small settlements hidden in the wild woodlands of Zemaitia. These settlements are led by Chud elders, Seniunas. These elders have served as commanders and mage-priests since before the arrival of men. With the emergence of the Antlered Ones their military influence have dwindled somewhat, but they are still central to the Chud society.
