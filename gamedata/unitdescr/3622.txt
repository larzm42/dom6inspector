When the caves of Pyrène were besieged by abysian armies the Bekrydes and their giant allies made a last stand. The Abysians were defeated, but at a tremendous cost. The last of the giants perished and the Bekrydes reformed their kingdom, not in the caves, but in the mountains above.
The Sorginak were scattered and hid in the mountains and forests of the land. Here they were approached by strange goats walking upright on their hind legs. These were the Akerbeltz, the Black Goats. They resemble the Panii of Pangaea, and the Pandemoniacs in particular, but they are far more sinister. Like the Panii they are skilled in the wild magic of nature, but their true power comes from blood magic. Their blood magic skills are almost unrivaled and only the warlocks of Abysia can compare.
The Black Goats approached, seduced and initiated the Sorginak in the mysteries of the Akelarre, the witches' sabbath. Now the Sorginak gathers around the Akerbeltz in caves, groves or meadows to perform dark ceremonies and blood sacrifices.
