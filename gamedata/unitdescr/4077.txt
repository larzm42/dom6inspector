In the Moonwood, where the dweomer of the Dreamwild was awakened in order to defeat the Ulmish invaders, Chud and human warriors don the furs of wild beasts and abandon culture. The awakened magic of the Dreamwild permeates their very bodies, endowing them with strange powers. When wounded their animal skins merge with their bodies, transforming them into savage beasts. Human Skinshifters take the shape of the wolf. The wolven Skinshifters of Zemaitia resemble the Skinshifters of Midg√•rd, but they fight with one sword in each hand and don't use great swords. The enchanted furs and transformative abilities of the Skinshifters allow them to heal wounds almost instantly.
