In Fort Vedun and a few other forts live the descendants of the Ulmish conquerors. These are of heavier stock than other Zemaitians and arm themselves with the weapons and armors used by the conquerors. The Castle Guards, armed with plate cuirasses and tower shields, are the elites of these Ulmish descendants.
