Most Zemaitians live in small settlements in the wild forests of Zemaitia, but in Fort Vedun and a few other forts live the descendants of the Ulmish conquerors. These Zemaitians have retained some of the technology of the Black Knights and their armies. Zemaite forts are defended by soldiers armed with heavy arbalests and plate cuirasses. The Ulmish descendants do not have the resistance to magic influences common to the inhabitants of the Zemaitian woodlands, but they are less susceptible to magic effects than the original Ulmish conquerors.
