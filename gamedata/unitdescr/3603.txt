The Sorginak were once servants and assistants of an ancient deity of storms and fertility. Their mistress reputedly gathered with her spouse in a cave beneath Mount Anboto to engender storms. With the disappearance of the deity the Sorginak have turned to mankind in search of purpose. For a long time they guided the people of the land as priestesses of fertility and storms. They formed bonds with other ancient forces and allied themselves with the Jentilak and the giants of the land. But with time, mankind became more numerous and arrogant and the Sorginak lost influence and became regarded as malign witches who brought storms and maladies upon men. Only with the arrival of the cave-dwelling Bekrydes did this change. The Bekrydes, allies of the Jentilak, accepted the Sorginak and revered them as priestesses of the ancient ways. Now the Sorginak gather in the witches’ cave under Mount Anboto, to engender storms and bring prosperity and fertility to the land.
The Sorginak are powerful air mages, but they also have some skills in nature, earth and water magic. Their mistress once taught them how to make an ointment that grants the user the ability to fly, even during stormy weather. Sorginak have darkvision and can transform into black cats.
