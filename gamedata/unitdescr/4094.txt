Fay Folk are small fay creatures from the Dreamwild who occasionally appear on the fringes of civilized lands. Few Fay Folk look alike, and many have animal features, but all fay are able to use glamour and their true appearance is rarely what it seems. Like all fay they are vulnerable to iron. All Fay Folk loves music and this particular one carries a brass trumpet. When directed at man or beast its tunes will mesmerize and confuse the target. The music also attracts sprites who vigourously defend the musician from agressors.
