The Serpent of Heavenly Fires is a serpentine entity spawned at the dawn of time when lightning struck the Sun. The serpent was approached by a demi-god given power over winds and weather by a previous Pantokrator. The pair mated and the Mother of Storms gave birth to the first storm. Frightened and cowed, the first men began to worship the couple to be spared from their wrath and receive their blessings. The Pantokrator was furious and imprisoned them under mountains for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone the serpent is breaking free from his prison ready to unleash thunder and storms upon the world in search of his imprisoned mate.
