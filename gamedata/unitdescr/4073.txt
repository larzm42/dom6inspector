Chudes are an exalted race of might and beauty far superior to ordinary men. They have lived in the Zemaitian woodlands since before the arrival of men, but for a long time they have lived side by side with humans. After the Black Knights had surrendered, some human Zemaitians adopted the ways of the Ulmish conquerors, but the Chudes kept to the old ways. They live in small settlements hidden in the wild woodlands of Zemaitia. Their warriors are remarkably skilled and use stealth to surprise their enemies. Traditionally they fight with a combination of axe and sword.
