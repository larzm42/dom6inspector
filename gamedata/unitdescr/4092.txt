The Lauma is a fay being of the Zemaitian woodlands that has been worshiped as a lesser divinity since time immemorial. It has the appearance of a woman with the head and lower parts of a goat with bird claws instead of hooves. They are beings of the wild woodlands and are closely associated with water. They live near lakes, rivers and streams and if three or more Laumas gather their dance will make it rain.
