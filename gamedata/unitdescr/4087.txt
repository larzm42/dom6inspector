For ages the Chud Veduns have gathered in the Moonwood and steeped themselves in the wild magic of the land. Over generations they have been transformed and endowed with magic powers beyond their peers and they have acquired the ability to shapeshift into moose. When the Black Knights of Ulm entered the Moonwood and erected Fort Vedun the Antlered Veduns gathered and released the slumbering magic of the Dreamwild. With the awakened powers of the Dreamwild the Chudes forced the Black Knights isolated in Fort Vedun to surrender. But the magic awakened in the forest did not dissipate and now the magic of the Moonwood is stronger than ever. Now Veduns, skinshifters and Sylvan Knights are all imbued with Dreamwild dweomer previously only rarely seen manifesting in the blood of the Antlered Veduns.
