When the Black Knights finally surrendered and swore allegiance to the Chudes there were not many of them left. The Chudes were impressed by the strength of the knights and a few of them approached the last human Hochmeister with a petition. If allowed to be ordained as knights they would swear allegiance to the Hochmeister and replenish the ranks of the order. The Hochmeister complied, but it soon became evident that the Chudes required stronger mounts. With the aid of the Antlered Veduns wild moose were caught, trained and imbued with the dweomer of the Dreamwild to serve as mounts for the Chud Knights. With time the last of the human knights had been replaced by moose-mounted Chudes. But something had happened when the magic of Fort Vedun was awakened. The strange magic of the Dreamwild started to permeate the citadel and ever more Chudes were born with antlers and superior strength. With time these antlered Chudes replaced the ungifted Chudes and the order of the Black Knights was reformed and became known as the Sylvan Order.
