Fay Folk are small fay creatures from the Dreamwild who occasionally appear on the fringes of civilized lands. Few Fay Folk look alike, and many have animal features, but all fay are able to use glamour and their true appearance is rarely what it seems. Like all fay they are vulnerable to iron. This particular one is remarkably large and looks almost like a human lady, apart from her donkey head. At times she opens her mouth to sing, only to interrupt herself, bewildered by the braying sound she makes.
