The caster summons a group of Fay Folk. Fay Folk are small fay creatures from the Dreamwild who occasionally appear on the fringes of civilized lands. Few Fay Folk look alike, and many have animal features, but all fay are able to use glamour and their true appearance is rarely what it seems. Like all fay they are vulnerable to iron.
