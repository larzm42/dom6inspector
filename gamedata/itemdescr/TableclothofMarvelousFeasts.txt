When this enchanted tablecloth is put on a table a marvelous buffet of exotic foods appear out of thin air. Soldiers can gorge themselves on the extravagant foods and drinks on the table. As long as the tablecloth remains on the table plates and carafes are refilled with food and wine. But the feast is conjured from the Dreamwild and is not real. The soldiers partaking in the feast might feel content, but they will still starve as no real nutrition has been provided by the marvelous feast.
