One man ruled the emerging civilization. When nearing the end of his days, he turned to Dark Arts to prolong his life and his rule. This corrupted the king's soul and in the end he used the lifeforce of all his subjects and that of the fertile land itself to avoid death. The kingdom was laid to waste, its soil barren and its people destroyed, their bleached bones littering the land. Some say his magic still lingers. Some say the ruins deep in the wasteland are no longer silent and that the lamentation of its long lost inhabitants can be heard faintly when the desert wind blows from the east.	story 1|turn 12|capital 0|unique 1|freesites 2|waste 1|code 0	code -62|incscale2 Death|unrest 2

Red did it flow at the end, its purity wasted, all hope forfeit under the sword of the cold-bringers.'

2858	Ancient lore concerning the cr	0	Ancient lore concerning the creation of the Throne has been found among the learned of this land. The Throne was created by four arch-mages and imbued by the emanations of the Pantokrator. On their path to ascendancy, each of the four  mages founded an order whose purpose was to protect the throne, so that one unworthy would not sit upon it. The runes on the throne are wardings of obscure purpose. There is one ward for each of the four elements.	targorder 100|unique 1|code 236	code 237
